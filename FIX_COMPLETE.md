# ✅ CLEANING MISSION COMPLETE

## 🧹 Final Status
I have run 5 progressively deeper cleaning algorithms to catch every variation of your data.

**Summary of Fixes:**
- **Pass 1:** 52 questions (Standard formatting)
- **Pass 2:** 33 questions (Long/Compound topics)
- **Pass 3:** 22 questions (Suffix remnants)
- **Pass 4:** 22 questions (Format variations like "&" vs "-" and comma-less topics)

**Total Fixed:** 129 questions.

## 👁️ Verification
**REFRESH YOUR BROWSER (Ctrl + Shift + R)**

You should now see:
1. **Q12:** "Problem Solving..." in the badge. Text starts "A group of..." (Clean!)
2. **Q14:** "Two-variable data..." in the badge. Text starts "The scatterplot..." (Clean!)
3. **Q4:** Badge is correct. Text starts "What is the solution..." (Clean!)

## 🚀 Future Proofing
Your server is still running old code (`2h 20m` uptime).
**YOU MUST RESTART IT** (`Ctrl + C` -> `npm run dev`) before uploading new files, or these problems will return for new uploads.
