## **Quick Test:**

Open a **NEW terminal** (keep backend running) and run:

```bash

```

**Expected:**
```json
{"status":"ok","message":"Server is active"}
```

3. ✅ Login as admin

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Cannot find module 'express'"

**Fix:**
```bash
npm install
```

Then try `npm run server` again.

---

### Error: "Port 3001 is already in use"

**Windows:**
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID <PID_NUMBER> /F
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
lsof -i :3001
kill -9 <PID_NUMBER>
```

Then try `npm run server` again.

---

### Error: Backend starts but crashes immediately

**Check the error message** in red text.

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Try again
npm run server
```

---

## 💡 Alternative: Start Both at Once

Instead of starting backend and frontend separately, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts **both** servers together! ✨

---

## ✅ **Success Checklist**

Before trying upload, verify:

- [ ] Backend terminal shows "SERVER SUCCESSFULLY STARTED"
- [ ] You see "✅ Upload Routes mounted at /api/upload"
- [ ] `curl http://localhost:3001/api/health` returns success
- [ ] Frontend is accessible at http://localhost:5173
- [ ] No red error messages in backend terminal

---

## 🎯 **The Fastest Way**

**Just run:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Wait 15 seconds**, then try uploading!

---

## 📞 **Common Questions**

**Q: Do I need to keep the terminal open?**
A: Yes! The backend must stay running while you use the app.

**Q: Can I use the app without the backend?**
A: No. The upload feature requires the backend server.

**Q: What if I close the terminal by accident?**
A: Just run `npm run server` again to restart it.
