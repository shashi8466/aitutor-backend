# 🛠️ HOW TO FIX "BACKEND SERVER NOT RESPONDING"

The error `❌ Backend server is not responding` means your browser cannot find the server at `localhost:3001`. 

It is **NOT** a Supabase error (yet). It's a "Local Server Down" error.

---

## ✅ STEP 1: Verify Supabase is Working (Optional)

I created a script to prove your Supabase is fine. Run this in your terminal:

```bash
node VERIFY_SUPABASE.js
```

If this says **"🎉 SUPABASE IS WORKING PERFECTLY"**, then your database is fine. The problem is purely that your backend server is OFF.

## ✅ STEP 2: Start the Backend (REQUIRED)

You must have the server running to upload files.

**Open a terminal and run:**

```bash
npm run server
```

**Wait until you see:**
```
🚀 SERVER SUCCESSFULLY STARTED
📡 Server Address: http://0.0.0.0:3001
✅ Upload Routes mounted at /api/upload
```

⚠️ **DO NOT close this terminal.** Minimize it, but keep it running.

---

## ✅ STEP 3: Test the Fix

1. Open a **New Terminal** (Keep the server running in the other one).
2. Run this command to verify the server is listening:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/upload/test
   ```
3. You should see:
   ```json
   {"message":"Upload routes are working!","serverStatus":"online",...}
   ```

---

## ✅ STEP 4: Upload Your File

1. Go back to your browser (http://localhost:5173).
2. Go to the Upload page.
3. Try uploading `Q11.docx` again.

**It will work now!** 🚀
